Simple benchmarking script for comparing different Ruby csv parsers.

Some of these gems will only work with MRI 1.8, as they are native extensions.

Sample CSVs are taken from:
presidents.csv > See People Software (http://seepeoplesoftware.com/downloads/older-versions/11-sample-csv-file-of-us-presidents.html)
geoip.csv 		 > MaxMind (http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecountry)

If you want to try a (significantly) larger file, MaxMind has a city-level geoip file as well: http://www.maxmind.com/app/geolitecity
